# Leading Question
Wikipedia can be modeled as a directed graph as follows: each page is represented by a vertex and each link from one page to another is represented by a directed edge. Using this representation we can ask the question, what would the shortest path between any two wikipedia articles be? With the tools to answer that we can then ask what is the diameter of wikipedia? In practical terms, given any page what is the maximum number of links one would have to follow to get to any other page? We can also examine what nodes are frequently passed through on traversals. What nodes are infrequently visited? In specific: what is the betweenness centrality of each node?
