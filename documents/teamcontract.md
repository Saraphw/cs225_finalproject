# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Inter-team communication:** The primary means of intergroup communication will be discord. Members can be contacted using discord or email and are expected to respond to either within one day.
2. **Meetings:** Each Thursday at 16:00 CST we will meet over discord to discuss the work everyone has done in the last week, next steps and expectations for the coming week, and draft that week's progress log. Meetings may be rescheduled if necessary but there should be at least one every week. Meeting notes will be archived in the github repo at /documents/meetings/[mm-dd].md

## Work Expectations
1. **Code:** Code should be well organized, well documented, and not overly obscure. Test cases should be written before or simultaneously along with project code.  
2. **Work allotment:** Each week, the necessary deliverables for the week will be determined by the full team and each member will volunteer to work on one or more deliverables. When no one volunteers, it will be assigned to the person who has the lightest workload. If this leads to an unbalanced workload for the week, adjustments can be made on a case by case basis.
3. **Time Commitment:** To ensure an equal distribution of work each member is expected to spend on average between 2-6 hours per week, not including meetings, on the project. If someone finds that their weekly deliverable will take more than this they should immediately alert the rest of the team and another person will volunteer to help.

## Respect
Each member of the team will treat the other members with respect by communicating promptly, honestly, and civilly.  

## Conflict Resolution
In the event of a disagreement between members the decision will be decided by majority vote. In the event of a three-way disagreement between members the decision will be chosen randomly. If one member consistently fails to meet expectations they will be asked to explain their situation, and a course will be agreed on from there. If the problem persists a staff member will be brought in.
