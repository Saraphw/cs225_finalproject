# Team Contract

## Communication
The primary means of intergroup communication will be discord. Members can be contacted using discord or email and are expected to respond to either within one day. Each Thursday at 16:00 CST we will meet over discord to discuss the work everyone has done in the last week, next steps and expectations for the coming week, and draft that week's progress log. Meetings may be rescheduled if necessary but there should be at minimum one every week. Meeting notes will be archived in the github repo at /documents/meetings/[mm-dd].md

If members feel that they are not able to complete the amount of work they volunteered for before the upcoming meeting for whatever reason they should alert the rest of the team promptly.
